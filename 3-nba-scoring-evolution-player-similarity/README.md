# 🏀 NBA Scoring Evolution & Player Similarity Analysis

This project explores long-term trends in NBA scoring and identifies player similarity profiles using both Python (Orange & notebooks) and interactive Tableau dashboards.  
It combines statistical analysis, clustering methods, and visual storytelling to uncover meaningful patterns in player performance over time.

## 📊 Project Overview

This analysis addresses two key questions:

1. **How has NBA scoring evolved over time?**  
   - Examines scoring patterns (e.g., total points, shot distribution) across decades.
   - Highlights era-based changes such as three-point adoption.

2. **Which players exhibit similar scoring profiles?**  
   - Uses data-driven clustering and similarity techniques to group players with comparable performance characteristics.
